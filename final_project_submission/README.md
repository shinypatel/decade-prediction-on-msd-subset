# Final Project README

# Installation
Copy the data used by the classifiers to the `code` directory. Data can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yearpredictionmsd

# Execution
* To run the Adaboost and SVM classifiers, simply call their respective files from the command line with python 3. For example: `python3 adaboost.py`. This will run the cross validation and print the model's accuracy values as well as more detailed analysis.
* The neural networks classifier can be run in a similar fashion with `python3 NN_master.py`, however the various tests that were performed need commented out within said file depending on what results are desired.

# Addition Files
Originally we tried analysis of the full dataset which can be found at: https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset . While the code is for this is now defunct due to poor results, its readme and modified Labrosa libraries can be found in the `hd5_aggregation` directory.
